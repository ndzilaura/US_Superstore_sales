# US_Superstore_sales

I worked with a dataset containing sales data of a super store located in 49 states in the US. 
Using pivot charts and excel charts I attempt 6 key business questions that will help the company to know the stores that are not profitable to be either shut down or monitored. I also want to show the managers what products generated the highest profits, to maximise their profits.
